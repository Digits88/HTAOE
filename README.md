Hacking: The Art Of Exploitation 2nd (HTAOE) Sample Source code.

## NB:
The sample codes in this collection are made to run on an Ubuntu-based Live Linux Distro. They are compiled under GCC version 3.3.6.  

Using the code in an updated system, you'll not "smash the stack", it will detect buffer overflows and segmentation fault
without overflowing the buffers.

## Tips
Use the Ubuntu-based live cd to play with the exploits... (or create a similar env)
